# AidJobs Master Plan - Consolidated Implementation Roadmap

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-03  
**Status**: Active Planning  
**Budget**: Cost-Effective (No Expensive Infrastructure)  
**Timeline**: 16-20 Weeks (Phased Implementation)

---

## Executive Summary

This document consolidates all planning discussions into a single, actionable roadmap for transforming AidJobs into an enterprise-grade, AI-powered job aggregator. The plan is structured to:

1. **Fix critical issues first** (data quality, extraction accuracy)
2. **Build on solid foundations** (no expensive infrastructure)
3. **Scale gradually** (5 sources → 40,000+ sources over 6 months)
4. **Deliver value incrementally** (user-facing and admin features)

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ Cost-effective (no LLM APIs, no Redis, no expensive infrastructure)
- ✅ Incremental (fix issues → enhance → scale)
- ✅ Data quality first (accurate extraction before new features)
- ✅ User value focused (remove low-value features, enhance core)

2. **Reliability Issues**
   - "Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't" (race conditions, error handling)
   - No link validation (apply URLs may be broken)
   - Inconsistent enrichment (not working correctly for all fields)

3. **Scalability Limitations**
   - Max 3 concurrent sources (won't scale to 40,000)
   - Processes 20 sources per run (5-minute intervals)
   - No queue system (SQL-based needed)
   - Basic scheduling (needs smart scheduling)

4. **Missing Features**

   - Integrate into crawl
   - Add admin endpoint

3. **Set Up Meilisearch**
   - Deploy Meilisearch (Docker)
   - Configure environment variables
   - Test and verify

### Next Week
4. **Complete System Audit**
   - Comprehensive review
   - Prioritized fix list
   - Implementation plan

5. **Enforce Design System**
   - Audit components
   - Fix inconsistencies
   - Document system

### Following Weeks
6. **Begin Phase 1**
   - Enhanced validation
   - SQL-based queue
   - Smart scheduling
   - Monitoring dashboard

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Priority**: Which phase should we start with? (Recommendation: Pre-Phase 0)
2. **Timeline**: Is 20 weeks acceptable? (Can be adjusted)
3. **Budget**: Any budget for AI APIs later? (Currently: $0)
4. **Features**: Any features to prioritize/deprioritize?
5. **Scaling**: Target number of sources by when? (Currently: 40,000+ over 6 months)

## Notes

- This plan is a living document and will be updated as we learn from implementation
- Each phase should be tested thoroughly before moving to the next
- User feedback should be incorporated continuously
- Performance benchmarks should be established before scaling
- All improvements are code-based (no expensive infrastructure)
- Can add AI APIs later if budget allows
